This is a **2D physics engine** made in **C++** with no libraries.
It was made during the physics engine module of the SAE Institute.
It was graded **2/20** (middlesex notation, where 1 is the best grade).

It has :

-   Circle colliders
-   [AABB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box) colliders
-   Broad phase collision detection with a grid

At first the demo scene was made in [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
But recently, I ported it to [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) so that I
could compile the projet to a web version with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).
You can left click to place circles and right click to place squares.
(PS : You can't scroll with the cursor inside the demo, I don't know why. Sorry.)

The project was also featured in 3 code review videos made by The Cherno :
