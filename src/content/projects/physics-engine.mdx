This is a **2D physics engine** made in **C++** with no libraries.
It was made during the physics engine module of the SAE Institute.
It was graded **2/20** (middlesex notation, where 1 is the best grade).

It has :

-   Circle colliders
-   [AABB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box) colliders
-   Broad phase collision detection with a grid
