This is a **2D physics engine** made in **C++** with no libraries.
It was made during the physics engine module of the SAE Institute.
It was graded **5,74/6**.

It has :

-   Circle colliders
-   [AABB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box) colliders
-   Broad phase collision detection with a grid

At first the demo scene was made in [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
But recently, I ported it to [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) so that I
could compile the projet to a web version with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

## What I Learned

-   **The math behind a physics engine**: Even though I already studied Newton's equations, applying them in code is a different challenge.
-   **Creating a CMake library**: Before this project, using CMake was quite complicated for me and in this project I read a lot of tutorials to be more confortable.
-   **What to think about when designing an API**: Since my physics engine is a library, I had to think about what the user code would look like.
-   **Optimization with data structures**: To optimize collision detection, we studied multiple data structures (KD-Tree, Quadtree, Grids). I choose to implement a grid.

## Code Reviews

The project was also featured in 3 code review videos made by The Cherno, who was an engine developper at Electronic Arts for 4 years.
In these, The Cherno looks at my code and makes comments on the various things that could be improved.
