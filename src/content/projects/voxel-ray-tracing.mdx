Final project of my studies at SAE Institute Geneva.
Implemented **Voxel Path Tracing** in a **Vulkan** compute shader using the **Jai** programming language.
The thesis document was made in **Typst**.

It features :

- Per-voxel and per-pixel lighting
- Diffuse, reflective and emissive materials
- A palette compressed world
- An environement map as a light source

## What I Learned

- **The Vulkan API**: As the project requires the use of compute shaders, and because I wanted to learn the API, Vulkan was chosen.
- **Jai**: At first the project started with Rust, but then I got access to the beta of Jai, so I decided to use it.
	It is aimed to be a replacement of C++ geared towards games and the "joy of programming".
- **Various path tracing techniques**: This project deepened my understanding of the subject, with things such as cosine-weighted sampling and russian roulette.
- **Statistics**: Doing real-time path tracing requires to apply some statistics concepts,
	and I also used student's T-test to prove than an optimisation made something faster.
