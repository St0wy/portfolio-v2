This is my **diploma project** for my technician formation that allowed me to get a **5.5/6** (swiss notation, where 6 is the best grade) and the **congratulations of the jury**.
It's a **3D engine** (rasteriser) made in **C#** (windows form, no graphics library) that allows to show models and organize them in a **scene graph**.
