This is my **diploma project** for my technician formation that allowed me to get a **5.5/6** (swiss notation, where 6 is the best grade) and the **congratulations of the jury**.
It's a **software 3D engine** (rasteriser) made in **C#** (windows form, no graphics library) that allows to show **3D models** and organize them in a **scene graph**.

## What I Learned

-   Linear Algebra
-   How Scene Graphs work
-   Online Documentation Creation
-   3D Models Loading
