This is my **diploma project** for my technician formation that allowed me to get a **5.5/6** (swiss notation, where 6 is the best grade) and the **congratulations of the jury**.
It's a **software 3D engine** (rasteriser) made in **C#** (windows form, no graphics library) that allows to show **3D models** and organize them in a **scene graph**.

## What I Learned

-   **Linear Algebra**: When I started this project, I had very little knowledge of the subject, and I had to learn most of it from a book provided by my teacher.
-   **How Scene Graphs work**: I also discovered how scene graphs work. Although the implementation is not optimal, I was able to learn the principles.
-   **Online Documentation Creation**: I had already worked on documentation before, but never for a project of this size. You can read it by clicking on the button below
-   **3D Models Loading**: The models in the project are loaded though a custom .ply loader.
