During the networking module at SAE Institute, we had multiple exercices to do.

The first thing we had to implement was a small conversation server.
For this, I used [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for the user interface
and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index-fr.php) to be able to use sockets.

</div>

We then had to do a turn-based game.
I decided to implement a Tic-Tac-Toe.
In this one I also used SFML for the graphics and not online the networking.

After that we started the big final project.
The task was to develop a game using the rollback engine of our teacher.
So I decided to redo [Atomic Ball](./atomic-ball) using SFML and by adding rollback to it.

Using the engine was really hard, the API was really complicated and it required a lot of boilerplate code to add really simple thing.
Also, the final game sometimes has random crashes that I wasn't able to solve.
But in the end, I'm quite proud of the work I did and it was really interesting to learn how to do
reliable data transfer using UDP.

I wrote a blog post where I explained broadly how the online in the game works :
