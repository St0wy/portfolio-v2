This is a **deffered PBR renderer** made in **C++** with **OpenGL** during the Computer Graphics class at SAE Institute.
It was graded **2/20** (middlesex notation, where 1 is the best grade).

It has :

- Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
- Image Based Lighting (IBL)
- Deferred Rendering
- Cascaded Shadow Maps
- Normal Mapping
- ACES HDR Tone Mapping
- Bloom
- Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
- Scene Graph
- Model Loading (OBJ and glTF)

I wrote a blog post where I explained some of the technical 
details behind this renderer on my blog : https://blog.stowy.ch/posts/opengl-renderer/
