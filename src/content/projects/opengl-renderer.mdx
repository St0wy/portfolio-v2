This is a **deffered PBR renderer** made in **C++** with **OpenGL** during the Computer Graphics class at SAE Institute.
It was graded **5,75/6**.

It has :

-   Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
-   Image Based Lighting (IBL)
-   Deferred Rendering
-   Cascaded Shadow Maps
-   Normal Mapping
-   ACES HDR Tone Mapping
-   Bloom
-   Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
-   Scene Graph
-   Model Loading (OBJ and glTF)
-   KTX Textures Loading

I wrote a blog post where I explained some of the technical
details behind this renderer on <a href="https://blog.stowy.ch/posts/opengl-renderer/" target="_blank">my blog</a>.

## What I Learned

-   The OpenGL API
-   GLSL
-   Multiple rendering techniques
-   My passion for the subject !
