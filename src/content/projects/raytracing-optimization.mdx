This project was made during the **optimization** module at SAE Institute.
The goal was to make a project in a **naive way**, and then **optimize** it using the various techniques we learned during the module.

I choose to follow **Ray Tracing in One Weekend** in **Rust**.
I think it was a good idea since the book has a big Object Oriented style which made it quite slow.
It allowed me to profit from Rust's design and work in a **Data Oriented** manner.

You can read about the optimizations I did on my blogpost : [Raytracing : From 6 minutes to 5 seconds](https://blog.stowy.ch/posts/raytracing-optimizations/).

## What I Learned

I learned a lot about how code is executed on modern CPUs.
Mostly on subjects such as :

-   Caches
-   Pipelining
-   Branch prediction
-   SIMD
-   Reading Assembly
-   Multithreading

I also learned the **math** and logic behind **Ray Tracing**.
