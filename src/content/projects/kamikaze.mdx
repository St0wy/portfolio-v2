This project was a relatively big (for a school project).
The idea was to create a Plant vs Zombie-like game with Kamikaze characters that explode upon reaching enemies.

We developed a detailed Game Design Document (GDD) outlining the game's progression and various troop and enemy types.
For instance, we considered a shield troop that blocks enemy advancement until it's defeated.
To introduce more engaging enemies, we thought of a slow yet resilient enemy capable of destroying the shield in a single hit.
Despite our efforts, the initial presentation to our teacher didn't go well as the fun factor was unclear.
However, we received feedback to incorporate synergies between troops, leading us to introduce an ice troop that freezes enemies and increases damage, as well as an enemy vulnerable only when frozen.
These additions significantly enhanced the enjoyment of the game.

The game is playable in your browser on the Itch.io page.
