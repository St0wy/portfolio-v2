This is a zelda-like game made in Unity for the Procedural Generation module at SAE Institute.

It was made in collaboration with my classmate Némoz.

He implemented the generation of the overworld an algorithm called the [Wave Function Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse#Use_in_procedural_generation).
As for the dungeons, I implemented them using the same algorithm than the one used in _The Binding of Isaac_.

At the time, I wrote a blog post in french on how the dungeons are made : [La génération procédurale de The Binding of Isaac](https://blog.stowy.ch/posts/isaac-proc-gen).
