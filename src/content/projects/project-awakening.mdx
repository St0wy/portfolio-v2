This is a **zelda-like** game made in Unity for the **Procedural Generation** module at SAE Institute.

It was made in collaboration with a classmate and was graded **5,95/6**.

He implemented the generation of the overworld with an algorithm called the [**Wave Function Collapse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse#Use_in_procedural_generation).
As for the dungeons, I implemented them using the same algorithm than the one used in **The Binding of Isaac**.
The character was made by me and my classmate did the enemies and the boss.

At the time, I wrote a blog post in french on how the dungeons are made : [La génération procédurale de The Binding of Isaac](https://blog.stowy.ch/posts/la-generation-procedurale-de-the-binding-of-isaac/).

## What I Learned

-   Improving Game Feel
-   Dungeon Procedural Generation
-   How to do animations with code in Unity
