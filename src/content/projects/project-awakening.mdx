This is a **zelda-like** game made in Unity for the **Procedural Generation** module at SAE Institute.

It was made in collaboration with a classmate and was graded **5,95/6**.

He implemented the generation of the overworld an algorithm called the [**Wave Function Collapse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse#Use_in_procedural_generation).
As for the dungeons, I implemented them using the same algorithm than the one used in **The Binding of Isaac**.

At the time, I wrote a blog post in french on how the dungeons are made : [La génération procédurale de The Binding of Isaac](https://blog.stowy.ch/posts/isaac-proc-gen).
