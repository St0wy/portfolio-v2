A collection of 4 games made each in 1 week. They where made during the Game Design module at SAE Institute.

I don't think these project are particularly amazing, but considering they where each made in a week, I think it's not that bad.
To project with the most orginality in terms of gameplay is the coop local maze game.

## Coop Local Maze Game

In this game, you must escape a maze with your friend.
The twist is that you and your friend each go through a different maze, and you don't see anything.
The only source of light is located where you friend would be if he was in your maze.
Since the mazes are different, you must cooperate by lighting the path of your friend and escape.

This game was made in collaboration with Benjamin.
