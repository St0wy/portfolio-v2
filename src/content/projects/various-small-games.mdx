A collection of 4 games made each in 1 week on Unity. They were made during the Game Design module at SAE Institute.
Each of these where made in a group of two, which was sometimes hard because not everyone had the same level on Unity.

I don't think these projects are particularly amazing, but considering they where each made in a week, I think it's not that bad.
To project with the most originality in terms of gameplay is the coop local maze game.

## Space Game

This is a top-down shmup where you must kill a certain number of enemies to finish the game.
There are two kinds of enemies, and you can shoot two types of bullets.

## Coop Local Maze Game

In this game, you must escape a maze with your friend.
The twist is that you and your friend each go through a different maze, and you don't see anything.
The only source of light is located where you friend would be if he was in your maze.
Since the mazes are different, you must cooperate by lighting the path of your friend and escape.

## Maze Game

I know, I'm very original with the names!

This game was the first one we made during the module.
It's very very simple, but it allowed us to start using Unity (although I already did some stuff with it in the past).

## Racing Game

This game is probably the least interesting one.
I basically followed a tutorial for the car movement, and the other person on the project did the map.

I like the music though.
