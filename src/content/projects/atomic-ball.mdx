**Arcade** game where 2 players are trying to get the highest score by going through doors.
Each player is restricted to one **half of the screen** and they have to **pass the ball** from one side to the other to be able to go through the dors that are on their path.
If one player touches the bottom of the screen, it's Game Over.
If one player doesn't touch the ball for too long, it will die.
So the players have to exange the ball regurlarly.

This project was made in **one week** during the **Swiss Game Academy** by a team of 6 persons : 2 artists, 1 game designer and 3 programmers.
During this gamejam, the game looked completly different.

We then continued to work on the game to fix bugs and change the artistic direction.
The game was then showed at multiple conventions such as **Hero Fest** and **Numerik Games**.
